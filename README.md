## My Process

### Built With

* Semantic HTML5
* CSS custom properties
* Flexbox
* CSS Grid
* Mobile-first workflow
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) (if used)

### What I Learned

In this challenge, I practiced writing clean semantic HTML and using CSS Grid and Flexbox to build responsive layouts. Here's an example of a component I enjoyed styling:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  padding: 1rem;
  background-color: #fff7f0;
  border-radius: 12px;
}
```

### Continued Development

I plan to continue focusing on:

* Improving responsiveness across more screen sizes
* Practicing accessibility techniques
* Mastering reusable styled components in React

### Useful Resources

* [CSS Tricks – Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
* [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) – Great reference for HTML/CSS concepts
